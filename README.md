## Architectural Overview

The architecture of our label detection application is designed for efficiency, scalability, and security. Hereâ€™s a
step-by-step walkthrough of the process:

### 1. User Request via API Gateway

- **Secured API Gateway**: User requests are handled through the API Gateway, which is secured with an API Key and a
  usage plan. The usage plan is throttled with a rate limit of 10 and a burst limit of 2 to protect against malicious
  requests.
- **Two Key Endpoints**:
    - **Get Upload URLs**: This endpoint accepts an array of images in a specified format, such
      as `{"id": "example-id", "type": "jpeg"}`. It responds with signed URLs and a unique request ID, which allows
      users to upload images directly to S3.
    - **Get Status**: This endpoint accepts a request ID and responds with the status of the request, including details
      like image IDs, classification, processing cost, time taken, and the service used.

### 2. S3 and Lambda for Image Processing

- **Image Upload to S3**: Users upload images to S3 using the provided signed URLs.
- **Triggered Lambda Function**: The upload to S3 triggers a Lambda function that resizes the images for optimal
  processing.

### 3. Step Function for Workflow Management

- **Step Function Invocation**: Once all images are resized, the AWS Step Function is invoked to manage the workflow.
- **Lambda for Initial Classification**: A Lambda function attempts to classify each image using Amazon Rekognition and
  updates the status in DynamoDB.
- **Handling Unclassified Images**: If some images remain unclassified, another Lambda function is triggered to use the
  GPTVision API for further classification. The results are updated in DynamoDB.

### 4. Finalizing and Notifying Status

- **Status Compilation**: The GetStatus Lambda function (also used for the API endpoint) compiles the status of all
  images from DynamoDB.
- **Notification via SNS**: The final status is outputted to the Step Function, triggering an SNS notification. All
  subscribers are then notified about the status of the image processing.

This architectural design ensures a streamlined process for image classification, balancing speed, accuracy, and
cost-effectiveness. It leverages the best of AWS services and cutting-edge image recognition technologies to deliver an
unparalleled user experience.

3. **Initial Setup for New AWS Environments**:
    - If deploying in a new AWS environment, run `cdk bootstrap` to initialize the CDK environment.
4. **GPT API Key in SSM**:
    - Since the CDK application uses AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to fetch the GPT API key, ensure the key is created in
      the
      same region where the deployment will occur.
        - The GPT API key should be added to the SSM parameter store under the path specified
          in `lib/constants/index.ts`, which
          currently is:
          ```typescript
          export const GPT_API_KEY_SSM_PARAMETER_NAME = "/image-classification/gpt-api-key";
          ```
5. **Application Configuration**:
    - Update the AWS region in `lib/constants/index.ts` if needed. The current setting is:
      ```typescript
      export const AWS_REGION = "ap-southeast-1";
      ```

### Deployment Process

1. **Install Dependencies at Root**:
    - Navigate to the root of the application directory and run:
      ```
      npm install
      ```
2. **Prepare Lambda Sharp Layer**:
    - Change directory to `lib/lambda/sharp-layer/nodejs` and execute the following commands:

      rm -rf node_modules/sharp
      SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install --arch=x64 --platform=linux --libc=glibc sharp
      ```
3. **Deploy with CDK**:
    - Return to the root of the application and deploy using AWS CDK by running:
      ```
      # run this command from the root folder of the project
      cdk deploy --all --require-approval never --profile <configured profile name>
      ```
      Replace `<configured profile name>` with your configured AWS profile name.
      Newer versions require a new package:
      ```
      npm install aws-cdk-lib
      ```

### Post-Deployment

- Upon successful deployment, the CDK will output the API Base URL. Make a note of these as they will be
